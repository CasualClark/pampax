curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || {
    echo "Service not running - starting deployment..."
    ./docs/production/deployment/production-deployment.sh
}
```

### 2. Health Monitoring
```bash
# Run comprehensive health check
./docs/production/runbooks/health-checks.sh --comprehensive
```

### 3. Cache Management
```bash
# Check cache status
./docs/production/maintenance/cache-hygiene.sh --status

# Optimize cache
./docs/production/maintenance/cache-hygiene.sh --optimize
```

### 4. Incident Response
```bash
# Emergency service recovery
./docs/production/runbooks/emergency-procedures.sh --service-outage
```
