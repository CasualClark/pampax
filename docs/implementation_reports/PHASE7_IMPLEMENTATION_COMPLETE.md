   - Human-readable explanations with specific numbers and conditions
   - Integration with token budget and result limiting systems
   - Actionable recommendations for each stopping condition

### **Evidence & Output Systems (All Complete)**
4. **Evidence Tracking System** ✅
   - Created `src/context/evidence-tracker.js` for comprehensive evidence capture
   - Integration points for all phases (search, graph, learning, intent)
   - Evidence serialization to structured format
   - Support for evidence filtering and analysis

5. **Markdown Generator** ✅
   - Created `src/context/markdown-generator.js` for human-readable output
   - Evidence table generation with all required columns (file, symbol, reason, edge type, rank, cached)
   - Stopping reason section with clear explanations
   - Token report with budget/used/model information
   - Structured, readable markdown output format

## 🚀 **FULL CLI INTEGRATION**

### **Command Examples (All Working)**
```bash
# Basic usage with markdown output
pampax assemble "authentication flow" --md > .pampax/context.md

# Enhanced mode with graph analysis
pampax assemble "user service" --enhanced --budget 5000 --graph-depth 3

# Complex query with filters
pampax assemble "api endpoints" --lang javascript --limit 15 --md

# Full explainable bundle
pampax assemble "database connection" --enhanced --md --budget 3000
```

### **Output Features**
- **Evidence Tables**: file, symbol, reason, edge type, rank, cached columns
- **Stopping Reasons**: Clear explanations with specific conditions and numbers
- **Token Reports**: Budget/used/model information with visual progress bars
- **Content Sections**: Structured code, memory, and symbol content
- **Performance Metrics**: Cache hit rates and assembly statistics
