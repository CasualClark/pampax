### Technical Implementation Details

#### Optimization Algorithm
- **Method**: Gradient descent with configurable learning rate
- **Loss Function**: Negative satisfaction rate (for minimization)
- **Gradient Calculation**: Based on correlation between seed weights and satisfaction
- **Convergence**: Detects when weight improvements fall below threshold
- **Constraints**: Enforces 0.1 to 5.0 weight bounds

#### Key Methods

1. **`optimizeWeights(signals, currentWeights, options?)`**
   - Main optimization entry point
   - Groups signals by intent for targeted optimization
   - Filters intents with sufficient data
   - Runs gradient descent loop
   - Returns optimization results with rollback data

2. **`applyWeightUpdates(weights)`**
   - Applies optimized weights through policy gate
   - Converts to repository policy format
   - Updates policy gate with new weights

3. **`rollbackWeights(rollbackData)`**
   - Reverts weights to previous state
   - Uses same policy gate integration
   - Ensures safe rollback capability

#### Configuration Options
```typescript
interface OptimizationOptions {
  learningRate?: number;        // Default: 0.1
  maxIterations?: number;       // Default: 100
  convergenceThreshold?: number; // Default: 0.001
  minSignalsPerIntent?: number;  // Default: 5
  weightBounds?: {
    min: number;                // Default: 0.1
    max: number;                // Default: 5.0
  };
}
```
