# Dart/Flutter Support Integration Summary

## Overview
Dart/Flutter support has been successfully integrated into PAMPAX, bringing the total supported languages to 22. This integration enables PAMPAX to index, search, and understand Dart codebases including Flutter applications.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Dependencies Added
- **tree-sitter-dart@1.0.0** added to package.json dependencies
- Parser imported and initialized in src/service.js

### 2. Language Configuration
The Dart language rule includes comprehensive support for:

#### Node Types
- `function_signature` - Function declarations and signatures
- `class_definition` - Class definitions
- `method_declaration` - Method declarations within classes
- `constructor_signature` - Constructor declarations
- `mixin_declaration` - Dart mixin declarations
- `enum_declaration` - Enum definitions
- `extension_declaration` - Extension methods

#### Variable Types
- `variable_declaration` - Local variables
- `top_level_variable_declaration` - Module-level variables
- `initialized_variable_declaration` - Variables with initial values
- `field_declaration` - Class fields

#### Comment Patterns
- `///` - Dart documentation comments
- `/** */` - Traditional block documentation comments

### 3. Supported Dart Features
The implementation supports all major Dart constructs:

```dart
// Classes and mixins
class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget { }
mixin LoggerMixin on Widget { }

// Functions and methods
void myFunction() { }
String calculate(int a, int b) { }

// Constructors
MyWidget({Key? key}) : super(key);

// Enums and extensions
enum WidgetState { loading, ready, error }
extension StringExtensions on String { }

// Variables
const String APP_VERSION = '1.0.0';
int _counter = 0;
```

### 4. Integration Points
- **File Extension**: `.dart` files are now recognized and processed
- **Symbol Extraction**: Functions, classes, methods, and variables are extracted
- **Documentation**: Dart doc comments are properly parsed and indexed
- **Chunking**: Dart code is properly chunked for semantic search
- **Embeddings**: Dart code can be vectorized for semantic search

## Usage

### Indexing a Dart Project
```bash
# Index a Flutter project
npx pampax index --provider openai

# Index with local provider
npx pampax index --provider transformers
```

### Searching Dart Code
```bash
# Search for Flutter widgets
npx pampax search "StatefulWidget"

# Search for specific methods
npx pampax search "build method"

# Search with Dart-specific context
npx pampax search "MaterialApp" --lang dart
```

## Testing
The implementation has been verified with:
- Syntax validation in service.js
- Language rule configuration verification
- Package dependency confirmation
- Sample Dart file parsing validation

## Benefits
1. **Flutter Development**: Full support for Flutter application codebases
2. **Dart Ecosystem**: Comprehensive coverage of Dart language features
3. **Semantic Search**: Find relevant Dart code using natural language queries
4. **Documentation**: Dart doc comments are indexed and searchable
5. **Cross-Reference**: Navigate between Dart functions, classes, and methods

## Next Steps
To fully utilize Dart support:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
2. Index your Dart/Flutter project: `npx pampax index`
3. Start searching: `npx pampax search "your query"`

## Files Modified
- `package.json` - Added tree-sitter-dart dependency
- `src/service.js` - Added Dart language import and configuration
- `README.md` - Updated supported languages count and list

Dart support is now fully integrated and ready for use! ðŸŽ¯
