- Review any pending technical debt items

### 2. Create Phase 8 Implementation Plan
- Break down Phase 8 into manageable tasks
- Prioritize features based on impact and complexity
- Estimate timeline for final phase completion

### 3. Define Advanced Features Scope
- **Caching Systems**: Multi-level caching strategies
- **Performance Optimizations**: Query optimization, indexing improvements
- **Production Features**: Monitoring, logging, error handling
- **Advanced Search**: Hybrid search improvements, relevance tuning
- **Scalability**: Large repository handling, memory optimization

### 4. Plan Final Integration and Testing
- Design comprehensive end-to-end testing strategy
- Plan performance benchmarking
- Prepare documentation for final release
- Plan deployment and distribution strategy

## Technical Context

### Repository State
- **Clean**: All Phase 7 changes committed and merged
- **Organized**: Documentation updated and structured
- **Stable**: All tests passing, no known issues

### System Architecture
- **Core Components**: All implemented and integrated
- **CLI Interface**: Fully functional with all commands
- **MCP Server**: Operational with tool integration

4. **Integration Features**: Enhanced IDE integrations, plugins

### Low Priority
1. **Experimental Features**: Cutting-edge search algorithms
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Deep usage insights and recommendations
3. **Extension Points**: Plugin architecture for third-party extensions

## Success Criteria for Phase 8
- All advanced features implemented and tested
- Performance benchmarks meet production requirements
- Documentation complete and user-friendly
- System ready for production deployment
- 100% phase completion (8/8)

## Architect's Decision Points
1. **Scope Finalization**: Confirm Phase 8 feature scope vs. time constraints
2. **Performance Targets**: Define specific performance benchmarks
3. **Production Readiness**: Determine production deployment requirements
4. **Final Release**: Plan release strategy and communication
