# PAMPAX Documentation Organization Summary

**Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **DOCUMENTATION REORGANIZATION COMPLETE**  

---

## 🎯 **Organization Objectives Met**

### ✅ **Phase 7 Documentation Organization**
1. **Moved `PLAN_07_EXPLAINABLE_BUNDLES.md`** → Already properly located in `completed_plans/`
2. **Moved specification `12_CONTEXT_EXPLAINABILITY.md`** → `completed_plans/`
3. **Updated implementation order** → Marked Phase 7 as COMPLETE
4. **Moved completion report** → `docs/implementation_reports/PHASE7_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`

### ✅ **Comprehensive Plan Organization**
1. **All completed phases (0-7) moved** → `docs/plans/completed_plans/`
2. **Implementation order updated** → All completed phases marked with ✅
3. **Future plans organized** → Remaining in main `docs/plans/` directory
4. **Duplicate cleanup** → No duplicate files found, all properly categorized
