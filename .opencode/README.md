# OpenCode Process Docs

This directory contains operational notes for the `.opencode` automation system:

- `agent/` – role descriptions for individual agent personas.
- `command/` – orchestration command reference guides.

These files were relocated from the repository root to keep all Markdown-based process documentation inside the `docs/` hub.
