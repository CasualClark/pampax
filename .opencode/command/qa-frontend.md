description: Run and summarize frontend quality checks
---
Run frontend quality gates and summarize the results, highlighting failures first.

Reference commands (may vary per project):
- analyze: `flutter analyze`
- tests: `flutter test`
- performance: profile builds as needed
- accessibility: manual/automated checks

If anything fails, propose the smallest patches to fix.
