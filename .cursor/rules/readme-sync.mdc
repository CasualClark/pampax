# README Synchronization Rule

## Purpose

This rule ensures that both [README.md](mdc:README.md) and [README_es.md](mdc:README_es.md) files are kept synchronized with the same content, only in their respective languages.

## Requirements

### Content Parity

-   Both README files must have identical structure and sections
-   All features, version numbers, and technical information must be the same
-   Only the language should differ between the files

### Version Consistency

-   Version numbers in headers must match exactly
-   Feature lists and "What's New" sections must have equivalent content
-   All technical specifications must be identical

### Structure Matching

-   Section headers must correspond (e.g., "üåü What's New" ‚Üî "üåü Novedades")
-   Table of contents must have equivalent entries
-   Code examples and commands should be identical
-   Links and references must point to the same resources

### Language Guidelines

-   README.md: English content
-   README_es.md: Spanish content
-   Technical terms may remain in English when appropriate (e.g., "MCP", "Node.js")
-   Commands and code blocks should remain identical

## When Making Changes

### To English README (README.md):

1. Make your changes to the English version first
2. Immediately update the Spanish version (README_es.md) with equivalent content
3. Ensure version numbers and technical details match exactly

### To Spanish README (README_es.md):

1. If changes are made to Spanish version, ensure English version is updated
2. Maintain consistency in technical information
3. Keep the same structure and organization

### Version Updates:

-   Always update version numbers in both files simultaneously
-   Feature announcements must be translated and included in both versions
-   Performance metrics and technical specifications must match

## Quality Checklist

Before committing changes to either README:

-   [ ] Version numbers match in both files
-   [ ] "What's New" sections have equivalent content
-   [ ] Table of contents corresponds between languages
-   [ ] All technical specifications are identical
-   [ ] Code examples and commands are the same
-   [ ] Links and references work in both versions
-   [ ] Structure and organization match
-   [ ] Both files are complete and well-formatted

## Examples of Synchronized Content

### Version Headers

```markdown
# English

**Version 1.11.x** ¬∑ **Semantic Search** ¬∑ **MCP Compatible** ¬∑ **Node.js**

# Spanish

**Versi√≥n 1.11.x** ¬∑ **B√∫squeda Sem√°ntica** ¬∑ **Compatible con MCP** ¬∑ **Node.js**
```

### Feature Announcements

```markdown
# English

üêç **Python Integration** - Full support for Python code indexing and semantic search

# Spanish

üêç **Integraci√≥n de Python** - Soporte completo para indexado de c√≥digo Python y b√∫squeda sem√°ntica
```

### Technical Commands

```bash
# Both versions should have identical commands
npx pampa index --provider transformers
```

This rule helps maintain professional documentation standards and ensures users get consistent information regardless of their language preference.
